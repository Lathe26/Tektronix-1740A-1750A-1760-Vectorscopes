# Tools

The tools located here are Python-based.  They were tested with Python v3.9.5.  Only the default libraries are needed.

The files here are:

- **scpi_normalize.py** - Tool that normalizes SCPI commands/responses to use full path, one per line.
- **scpi_doc_generate.py** - Tool that generates documentation for SCPI.
- **Format Markdown Description.txt** - A format file used by scpi_doc_generate.py to auto-generate somewhat descriptive documentation in Markdown format.
- **Format Markdown Summary.txt** - A format file used by scpi_doc_generate.py to auto-generate summary documentation in Markdown format.

Python files have been run through `pylint` to not produce warnings.
